# How to compile and run
Clone the repo and open `build.gradle` in Android Studio. Make sure to have an Android Emulator with an API version 8.0.x (Oreo) **or newer** set up. Also make sure you have an internet connection. After following these steps you will be able to run the app. To do so, simply press the "play-button" as shown below. You can also connect your own Android device if you wish to use this instead of an Android Emulator. To see how to connect your own device, se [this page](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device). Remember that this is a multiplayer game, so in order to play atleast 2 players must participate in the game.
